# Usage

Clone the template and have a look at its code. Don't blindly trust it since it might not work for you.

`git clone git@github.com:Zorros/rails3-template.git`

`rails new app_name -J -T -m rails3-template/main.rb`

Take into account that this is currently a work in progress and is not 100% finished. So, some things might not work as expected... or might not work at all.
